# DTMF_Detector

Detecting which key is being pressed by the user on the telephone keypad, has got major application in IVR services.
In this project we aim to use MATLAB to simulate  Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF). 
Using Goertzel Algorithm, the key being pressed is decoded from the 8-bit binary pattern recieved.
